- Little planner application -
I made this because i wanted to try out some of the new JavaFX stuff and to keep track of events i want to go, because i dont use facebook anymore and therefore also dont use the event calendar thing they have.
As of now it's pretty bare bones:
  - you can save/edit links to websites (i.e. for venues you frequent)
  - load these links in the webviewer so you can browse the website (you can also just add a link manually to browse to in the webviewer part)
  - ability to add events to your calendar if you see anything you would like to go to in the webviewer

 Things i want to do in the future:
  - make it possible to have multiple different agenda's
  - add page link automatically when adding a new activity
  - make/implement an installer for it
  - GUI updates/making UX better
